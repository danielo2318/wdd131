        <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
        <p>
          7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
          and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
          Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.

        <h2>Alma 36:3</h2>
        <p>
          3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and
          therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of
          me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be
          supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions,
          and shall be lifted up at the last day.
